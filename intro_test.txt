A territory is commonly defined as a defended area (Noble 1939, Maher and Lott 1995). Many animals need a territory to raise their offspring, and thus an individual's fitness strongly depends on choosing and obtaining a good territory (e.g. birds: Cody 1985; and mammals: Groenendijk et al. 2015). Territory selection has traditionally been studied by comparing individuals' territory locations during one breeding season and any associated, potentially correlated variables (Verdolin and Slobodchikoff 2010, Greenwood and Dawson 2011, Harrison et al. 2011). Although territoriality is observed in a variety of taxa such as fish (Armstrong et al. 1997), mammals (Woollard and Harris 1990), and of course birds (Reed and Oring 1992), the actual process of territory prospecting – how animals search and gather information to ultimately obtain a territory (Reed et al. 1999, Calabuig et al. 2010) and what traits co-vary with it –, is not well described in wild populations. This is surprising since the process of prospecting for different territories is assumed to be costly in terms of time, risk taking, and other resources; a cost that is intensified by competition with other prospectors (Reed et al. 1999, Bonte et al. 2012). Furthermore, territories are often held over several years, thus the choice of which territory to settle in may have long-term fitness consequences across years (i.e. carry-over effects, O'Connor et al. 2014). Therefore, investigating territory fidelity and prospecting during one reproductive season alone is insufficient; a better approach would be to study territorial behaviours throughout the year and over multiple years (Marra et al. 2015).

Both early territory acquisition and holding one during breeding are usually associated with greater reproductive success in birds (Perrins 1970, Verhulst and Nilsson 2008, Matechou et al. 2015). It is expected that territory prospecting takes place early in the season (Ponchon et al. 2015), during which, inter- and intra-specific competition for nest sites is common, especially in birds (Semel and Sherman 2001, Kokko et al. 2004, Haynes et al. 2014). This competition is expected to promote individual variation in nest site (territory) prospecting behaviour and acquisition. Furthermore, as the capability to defend and keep a territory is likely to change during an individual's lifetime, territory prospecting can be expected to co-vary with age (Cadiou et al. 1994). For example, young individuals have greater difficulties obtaining nest sites (Jakobsson 1988, Eikenaar et al. 2009), mates (Bayne and Hobson 2001) and extra-pair paternities (Cleasby and Nakagawa 2012), and have, possibly as a result of this, lower breeding success (Sasvári and Hegyi 2011) than older individuals. These differences might be explained by increasing experience with age, but they might also reflect different needs or different cost/benefit ratios at different life-history stages (Harts et al. 2016). Thus, in species that hold territories year-round and show high territory fidelity, first-time breeders, who need to acquire a territory for the first time, are expected to show more frequent territory prospecting than older, established territory owners.

Individual behavioural consistency or animal personality has been shown in many taxa ranging from spiders (Keiser et al. 2014) to lizards (Bajer et al. 2015) and birds (Hollander et al. 2008). Different individuals show different personalities and these differences are maintained over time and across contexts (Dingemanse and Réale 2005). Personality influences how individuals cope with life challenges, which in turn can affect survival and fitness (Santos et al. 2015). For example, differences in personality between individuals can be associated with differences in foraging (Amy et al. 2012, Kurvers et al. 2012), predation risk (Réale and Festa-Bianchet 2003), dispersal (Dingemanse et al. 2003, Cote et al. 2010), singing behaviour (Naguib et al. 2016) and nest site selection (Seltmann et al. 2014). Personality traits are often measured in captive single-individual (i.e. non-social) behavioural assays (Dingemanse et al. 2002, Quinn and Cresswell 2005). Although captivity allows the standardizing of environmental conditions, it excludes both the natural abiotic and social environment, which may impede assessing the ecological and behavioural relevance of the traits measured (Niemelä and Dingemanse 2014). Thus, if personality traits measured in captivity are ecologically relevant and maintained across contexts, we can expect that, for example, individuals that are highly active in captivity would show increased territory prospecting in the wild, and vice versa.

Most bird species need a territory to build a nest and lay their eggs. Secondary cavity nesters that accept nest-boxes, such as the house sparrow Passer domesticus, are a good model species to study territory fidelity and prospecting because their breeding attempts can be easily monitored and nest-box owners and prospectors can be identified by colour rings and transponders. House sparrows tend to breed in loose colonies and limit their territory to the immediate vicinity of their nest (-box) (Anderson 2006). This relatively small size of their territories further facilitates the study of territory prospecting in this species by allowing easy, automatic recording of territory (nest-box) visits made by prospectors. Additionally, the study of territoriality in the house sparrow may help us to better understand the potential mechanisms of its dramatic decline over the last decades (BirdLife-International 2015).

This study aims to test three hypotheses about territory fidelity and prospecting. 1) Individual birds show high territory fidelity between years and also during winter. 2) Individuals will prospect for a breeding territory during their first winter whereas older, more experienced individuals will keep a territory from previous years and will, therefore, show no or reduced winter territory prospecting. 3) More active behavioural types will prospect more than less active behavioural types. We test these hypotheses using four years of data from a wild, insular house sparrow population. We expect older, more experienced sparrows to preferentially visit their previous and/or future breeding nest-box during the winter (i.e. winter territory fidelity). Furthermore, we predict that individuals in their first winter will visit (prospect) more nest-boxes than older, more experienced birds. Lastly, we also expect that the number of nest-boxes visited during winter will correlate positively with two behavioural traits, nestling and post-fledging activity.
